      <description>The F Pixel by Meta Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a Facebook version of Mixpanel or a data analytics tool used to track user behavior across app, web, iOS, or any device with Chrome. The purpose is to collect user data‚Äîof course, with consent (whether to be tracked or not üßë‚Äçüíª)‚Äîto help business owners run personalized ads and campaigns via Facebook.
It‚Äôs as simple to use as embedding an image. This is because, theoretically, for all practical purposes, it‚Äôs just a 1px x 1px pixel embedded in your HTML DOM, along with some scripts that send data to Facebook&amp;rsquo;s servers.</description>

      <description>Shortly after joining a Bangalore startup after college, due to my previous experience in working with auth systems, I was given the task to change the current auth system from admin-secret based to a token-based auth system. with our prod server having an active user base of 5000 plus users daily.
Adding more spice to the curry, since the app is used by children, we don‚Äôt want them to be redirected to a login screen after the new auth system is implemented.</description>

      <description>Hey readers! I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to start documenting my learning journey as a web developer, and this blog marks the beginning of that adventure. From now on, I will be sharing my experiences, challenges, and progress as a full stack developer.
